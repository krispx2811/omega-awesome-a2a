Prompt: Explain quantum computing in simple terms.
Response: Explain quantum computing in simple terms.

Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. In classical computing, data is represented as bits, which can have a value of either 0 or 1. In quantum computing
